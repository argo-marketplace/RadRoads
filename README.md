## Why
Roads, everybody loves complaining about them - very few actually study them. Here is one way to uncover insights and have fun!

## What
OSMnx is an incredible Python package that lets you study your city's streets in new and interesting ways, programmatically.

This project aims to create a few explore. For any given city, you can use OSMnx to calculate:

- The longest, contiguous road.
- The shortest road segment
- The curviest road.
- The straightest road?
- The road with the most intersections.
- Other rad stats!?
