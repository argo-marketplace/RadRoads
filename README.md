# RadRoads
Using OSMnx to find Rad Roads in any city!

## Why
Roads, everybody loves complaining about them - very few actually study them. Here is one way to uncover insights and have fun!

## What
*Open Street Map - Network* or **OSMnx** is an incredible Python package that lets you study your city's streets in new and interesting ways, programmatically.

This project aims to create a few explore fun network based statistics that can be applied on a given city's street network. In this project, we will focus on New York City, Los Angeles, and Boulder's Streets.

For any given city, you can use OSMnx to calculate:

- What is the the longest, contiguous road?
- What is the shortest road?
- What is the curviest road? [**Check out Lombard Street in San Francisco**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/402111597)
- What is the straightest road? (Great for cities to plan Autonomous vehicle pilots)
- The road with the most intersections.
- Other rad stats!? You tell us!
