# Rad Roads India Edition

Built by using the RadRoads script (see demo [here](https://github.com/argo-marketplace/RadRoads/blob/master/notebooks/demo_radroads.ipynb)), we examine urban morphologies of Indian cities. How does the street typology of Indian cities compare between, (and within) themselves?

Major cities across the Indian subcontinent have been shaped by history, geography, and culture. Some cities have a highly distinct morphology:

* **Chandigarh:** Rectilinear, and heirarchical street layout
  + Considered to be a prime example of post-war modernism, [Chandigarh](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/9552697#map=13/30.7300/76.7769) was planned and built in the post-Independence period India by Le Corbusier - a highly influential albeit controvertial figure in the modernist movement. Chandigarh is a union territory, one of two types of second level subdivisions in India - controlled directly by the union government - therefore the name. We use the geographical boundaries of the Chandigarh Union Territory for our study.

* **Mumbai:** linear shape, and Marine Drive hook
    + Mumbai's location on the west coast of India meant that it was literally the 'Gateway of India' for ships sailing in from Britain. There's an actual arch in Mumbai called the [Gateway of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_of_India). Its harbor and importance to the British made it develop into a major urban center from the mid-19th century, and it remains so today, with its urban areas having expanded far beyond the original 7 islands. In this study, we will focus on the area covered by the [Bruhanmumbai Municipal Corporation](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7888990#map=11/19.0803/72.8854), which covers most of the now-fused together islands, except the municipal corporations of Thane and Mira-Bhayander. 
  
* **Delhi:** Lutyensian layout of New Delhi
  + Among these three cities, Delhi's history as an important urban center, and especially as a seat of power has been [consistent for several centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delhi). Thus its districts show an imprint of development across centuries: the 12th century Nizamuddin Basti, 16th century Shahajahanabad, early 20th century Lutyen's Delhi, mid-late 20th century extensions, and the 21st century development of satellite towns like Noida, and Gurgaon, which although separate cities, are an integral part of Delhi. For this study, we will be considering the boundaries of the NCT (National Capital Territory), Gurgaon, and Noida.
